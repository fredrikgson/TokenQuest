You can redirect a 'Potion' card from any player to any other player. This means that you are allowed to redirect a 'Potion' card from another player to yourself.

You may use this effect at any point in the game when any player draws a 'Potion' card, and however many times you want this game, as long as you remember it.

If another 'Potion Master' is drawn, the effect of this 'Potion Master' is removed. There can never be more than one 'Potion Master' in effect."
