extended_description = "You bought a suspicious plant from the local herb man and started to hallucinate.

Choose an object in the room that all players can see, but don't tell them which one it is. Now, give the other players a clue of what the object is by saying 'I spy with my little eye...' followed by something that describes the object.

For instance, if you choose a drinking glass, you could say 'I spy with my little eye something that is transparent'.

The player that first guesses the object correctly gains 2 Tokens. Also, you gain 1 Token.

All other players (the losing ones) are penalized with 6 swigs."
