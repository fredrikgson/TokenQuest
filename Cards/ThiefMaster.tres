After this card has been drawn, your turn is considered to be over. Thus, you may not use the effect of 'Thief Master' on the same turn you drew it.

Therefore, the effect of 'Thief Master' must be used on your own turn BEFORE drawing a card, and can be used for the first time on the NEXT turn after drawing it.

You are allowed to stack effects of 'Thief Master'. Meaning, if you have drawn 2 copies of this card during this game, you may steal 2 Tokens on the start of your turn. These do not have to be from the same player."
