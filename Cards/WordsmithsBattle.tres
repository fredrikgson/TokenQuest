The next player (you choose the direction) must then say a word within that same category that begins with the last letter of your word. The third player must then say a word within the category that begins with the last letter of the previous player's word, and so on...

When a player cannot produce a word within a reasonable time, they lose. That player is penalized with 4 swigs.

For instance, if 'countries in the world' is chosen as a category and the first player says 'Hungary', the second player can say 'Yemen', the third player can say 'Nicaragua', and so on...

For optimal fun, choose a reasonably wide category such as 'countries', 'food items', etc..."
