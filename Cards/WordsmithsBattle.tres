When a player repeats an item that was already named, or cannot name an item within a reasonable time, they lose. That player is penalized with 4 swigs.

Some examples of categories:
 
- 'Countries in Africa' (Egypt, Morocco, Chad, etc...)

- 'Beer brands' (Corona, Budweiser, Heineken, etc...)

- 'Programming languages' (C, Python, PHP, etc...)"
