#### --- What is TokenQuest? ---
This is TokenQuest, an easy-to-play drinking game inspired by Ring Of Fire/King's Cup. The current version is a fully working and playable game, albeit very bare bones.

The game is suitable for around 3-8 players, in practice there is no player limit but the game does require slightly more attention than your traditional game of Ring Of Fire/King's Cup, so having too many players may result in a mess.

The game has players drawing from a deck of cards and following the instructions printed on them. There are loads of unique cards and the deck is **randomly generated** for each game, so no two games will be alike!

#### --- What is needed to play ---
1. A single smartphone to run TokenQuest on
2. Something to represent Tokens (anything that you have a relatively large amount of, candy pieces are perfect)
3. Drinks!

#### --- How to play ---
All participating players get seated around the designated TokenQuest smartphone. You will need to gather up your Tokens into a pile or place them in a bowl to keep them separate from each player's own Token pile. This will be the bank of Tokens. Whenever a card states to "gain Tokens", you transfer Tokens from the bank to the player's own Token pile. Likewise, if a player is instructed to lose Tokens, they transfer Tokens from their own pile to the bank.

Determine which player will go first by any means of your choice (roll a die, make the youngest player go first, etc...). That player then begins the game by drawing a card. This is done by simply tapping the deck on the screen. The player then reads the card out loud and follows the instructions. Once the card has been resolved, the turn passes to the next player in a clockwise order. That player then proceeds to draw another card and follow the instructions. The game continues like this until the last card is drawn and the game is over!

#### --- Cards ---
There are different **types** of cards in TokenQuest. The type is indicated by the color of the card border:
- **Treasure** (Green) - A benefit to the player who drew the card.
- **Trap** (Red) - A detriment to the player who drew the card.
- **Quest** (Yellow) - An action to be taken by the player who drew the card.
- **Event** (White) - A card that affects all players.
- **Duel** (Purple) - A "minigame" between two players.
- **Rule** (Blue) - A change to how the game is played.

These definitions are not necessary to know in order to play the game, as all instructions will be printed on the card.


In addition, there are also different card **rarities**. A card's rarity is indicated by the small colored circle in the top left corner.
- **Common** (White)
- **Rare** (Blue)
- **Epic** (Purple)
- **Legendary** (Gold/Yellow)
- **Superlegendary** (Black)
- **Special** - Reserved for certain cards that will have special treatment in the deck building algorhithm.


Certain cards are anomalies, and aren't treated in the same regard as regular cards in the deck building algorhithm.
- **Dawn and Dusk** - Will always be the first and last card in every deck.
- **The Four Horsemen** - Four unique cards which add a unique mechanic to a game of TokenQuest. They will not appear in every game, but when they do, all four of them will be in the deck.
- **Superlegendaries** - Very rare cards with highly impactful effects that appear in far from every deck.





#### --- Dev notes ---
Currently, I haven't published a built version of the game. This is partly because the game is very bare bones as of now, but also because there are still values that needs to be tweaked to make the game as fun as possible. Due to the nature of how the deck of cards is constructed there is no real way to tell if the values are good or not without doing a couple of rounds of testing :)

However, I do think that this game is very fun and has potential, so I will most likely keep on tweaking the numbers until I'm reasonably satisfied, add some menu functionality, and post a built version in the near future!
